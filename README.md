🚦 Advanced Smart Traffic Scene Analysis using Computer Vision
📌 Project Overview

Advanced Smart Traffic Scene Analysis is an intelligent traffic monitoring system built using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
The project focuses exclusively on traffic scene understanding, where vehicles and pedestrians are detected, analyzed, tracked, and interpreted to understand traffic conditions such as density, congestion, flow trends, anomalies, and incidents.

This system simulates a smart city traffic monitoring solution by combining real-time visual perception with traffic analytics and automated reporting.

🎯 Project Objectives

* To detect vehicles and pedestrians from traffic images and live video using deep learning techniques.
* To analyze traffic density and classify traffic conditions as low, moderate, or heavy.
* To track vehicles across frames and estimate their speed for traffic analytics.
* To identify congestion zones, traffic anomalies, and generate automatic traffic reports for decision support.
